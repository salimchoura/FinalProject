        <h1>How to Foody</h1>
        <p>
            Welcome to Foody, the social media site for foodies!
        </p>
        <p>
            At Foody, we want to make sure you have the best experience 
            possible on our website, and we don't want our website's 
            structure to get in the way of your cooking enjoyment. If 
            you need help with any of our features, you've come to the 
            right place. Below you can find a simple how-to guide for 
            each and every one of our website's features. Happy cooking!
        </p><br>
        <h2>Navigation</h2>
        <p>
            At the top of every page, you can find a handy navigation bar 
            with direct access to every page of the website. To visit the 
            Home page, click on "Home." To log in or sign up for an account, 
            click on "Sign Up / Login." To access this page, click "Help." 
            To access our forum, click "Explore forum." Finally, to find 
            your next favorite recipe, click "Explore recipes." Each one of 
            these pages may connect to other pages that you can only find 
            there; these pages will be described in their respective sections.
        </p><br>
        <h2>Accounts</h2>
        <p>
            To sign up for an account, simply enter a username and password 
            in the "Create Account" section of our login page. This also 
            appears when you first navigate to our website, although you can 
            click on any other page in the navigation bar if you would prefer 
            to continue as a guest. However, if you are not logged in with 
            your account, you cannot review recipes, add forum posts, or 
            share recipes. To log in, simply type your registered username 
            and password into the respective fields on the login page (these 
            will be in the "Login" section). That's it! Now you have full 
            access to all of Foody.
        </p><br>
        <h2>Home Page</h2>
        <p>
            The home page displays a slideshow of foods. You can swipe to the 
            left or right to see other delicious foods. Maybe they can be
            inspiration for your next yummy creation!
        </p><br>
        <h2>Exploring Recipes</h2>
        <p>
            On the "Explore recipes" page, you will find a search bar, which 
            you can use to search for recipes by their title. There is also 
            a button for you to add your own recipe, but we will get to that 
            later. Just use the search bar to type in a keyword (or many 
            keywords). Your search results will appear as images, which you 
            can click on to see the recipe used to create the food in the 
            image. Once you click on the image, you will be taken to the 
            recipe's page, where you can see how to make it, the ingredients 
            you'll need, and some nutrition facts. You can also see reviews. 
            A bar chart is shown displaying the overall distribution of the 
            reviews, and users' comments are displayed below. You can even 
            provide your own review, or update a review you left previously 
            (provided that you are logged in, of course). Just click on the 
            star representing your review (for example, click on the fourth 
            star from the left to give a four-star review) and write a 
            comment, and then click "post!"
        </p><br>
        <h2>Adding a Recipe</h2>
        <p>
            If you're logged in, you can add your own recipes. But be careful!
            If you are not logged in, then you will be redirected back to the
            login page so you can log in and post your delicious treats. When
            you add a recipe, you will be asked for your recipe's title, the 
            grams of protein, carbs, and fat present, the recipe instructions,
            and an image to go along with your recipe. In addition, you can
            specify the ingredients in your recipe. You can add as many 
            ingredients as you'd like, but make sure to click on "Add 
            ingredient" as many times as there are ingredients in your recipe
            <i>before</i> you add all of your ingredients. You cannot add on 
            new ones as you go along. Finally, once you're done creating your 
            recipe, click "Create Post" to add your recipe to our website. You
            can go back up to the navigation bar and click "Explore recipes" 
            and then search for your recipe to admire the awesome work you 
            just did!
        </p><br>
        <h2>Exploring the Forum</h2>
        <p>
            On the "Explore forum" page, you will be met with a search bar, a
            search button, and a "Make Post" button. This searchbar is what
            you will use to type in keywords of the food-topic of your choice
            and press the "search" button to view posts that contain the keyword
            you put in their text content. They will appear as usernames of the 
            user that posted them, and the title that was entered by the maker of
            the post. To further observe the post of your desire from the selection
            presented to you, you can click on the titles. Afterwards, you will be
            redirected to a post page in which you will once again view the username
            of the poster, the title of the post, but on top of that, also whether 
            the post is an advice or is a question instead right next to the username.
            Additionally, you can also see comments made by other users, and you
            yourself may also leave a comment, however, for this feature, you must
            be logged in. After you type out the comment you would like to leave,
            you can confirm by pressing "Add Comment".
        </p><br>
        <h2>Adding a Forum Post</h2>
        <p>
            When you are a logged in user, and you press on the "Make Post" button
            you will be redirected to a new page in which you now get to write
            and post your very own forum post. You might have a question about the
            flavor compatibility between two ingredients and want to ask about it,
            in which case you select the "question" option to show people that visit
            your post that it is a question. On the other hand, if you have a fun
            fact or a valuable tip you would like to share, you can select the 
            advice option instead and type in the advice. To finalize your post,
            just press the "Create Post" button and it will be searchable by
            other users as well. Unfortunately, if you attempt even just visiting
            the page to create a new post, it will redirect you to the login and 
            account creation page to login first. 
        </p><br>
        <h2>Editing a Forum Post</h2>
        <p>
            In case you accidentally post a forum post way too early by accident,
            whether it is because of incomplete information or a missing title, 
            then fortunately you have the option to edit the posts that you made. 
            To do so, you only need to click on the "edit" button right below the
            the text block on the post page, and you will be redirected to the 
            post edit page. In it, you will still see what you had written previously
            and either choose to continue writing, or delete unwanted sections from
            the content and the title areas. However, you are not allowed to change
            the question/advice tag of the post and you need to be aware that you
            picked the right post tag. After you are satisfied with your changes
            simply press the "edit post" button and it will save your changes, 
            allowing your post to be searchable on the forum with its improvements.
        </p><br>
        <h2>Adding a Comment</h2>
        <p>
            When you are on the post page, as previously mentioned, you get to view
            comments made by everyone including you. To make a comment all you need
            to do is type in the comment you would like to leave to that particular
            post and then press the "add comment" button, which will save your comment
            and make it visible to everyone viewing the same post instantly. However,
            just like most of the other features, you must be logged in to leave a 
            comment because doing so without logging in will result in an alert popping
            up warning you about this issue.
