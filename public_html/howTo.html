        <h1>How to Foody</h1>
        <p>
            Welcome to Foody, the social media site for foodies!
        </p>
        <p>
            At Foody, we want to make sure you have the best experience 
            possible on our website, and we don't want our website's 
            structure to get in the way of your cooking enjoyment. If 
            you need help with any of our features, you've come to the 
            right place. Below you can find a simple how-to guide for 
            each and every one of our website's features. Happy cooking!
        </p><br>
        <h2>Navigation</h2>
        <p>
            At the top of every page, you can find a handy navigation bar 
            with direct access to every page of the website. To visit the 
            Home page, click on "Home." To log in or sign up for an account, 
            click on "Sign Up / Login." To access this page, click "Help." 
            To access our forum, click "Explore forum." Finally, to find 
            your next favorite recipe, click "Explore recipes." Each one of 
            these pages may connect to other pages that you can only find 
            there; these pages will be described in their respective sections.
        </p><br>
        <h2>Accounts</h2>
        <p>
            To sign up for an account, simply enter a username and password 
            in the "Create Account" section of our login page. This also 
            appears when you first navigate to our website, although you can 
            click on any other page in the navigation bar if you would prefer 
            to continue as a guest. However, if you are not logged in with 
            your account, you cannot review recipes, add forum posts, or 
            share recipes. To log in, simply type your registered username 
            and password into the respective fields on the login page (these 
            will be in the "Login" section). That's it! Now you have full 
            access to all of Foody.
        </p><br>
        <h2>Home Page</h2>
        <p>
            The home page displays a slideshow of foods. You can swipe to the 
            left or right to see other delicious foods. Maybe they can be
            inspiration for your next yummy creation!
        </p><br>
        <h2>Exploring Recipes</h2>
        <p>
            On the "Explore recipes" page, you will find a search bar, which 
            you can use to search for recipes by their title. There is also 
            a button for you to add your own recipe, but we will get to that 
            later. Just use the search bar to type in a keyword (or many 
            keywords). Your search results will appear as images, which you 
            can click on to see the recipe used to create the food in the 
            image. Once you click on the image, you will be taken to the 
            recipe's page, where you can see how to make it, the ingredients 
            you'll need, and some nutrition facts. You can also see reviews. 
            A bar chart is shown displaying the overall distribution of the 
            reviews, and users' comments are displayed below. You can even 
            provide your own review, or update a review you left previously 
            (provided that you are logged in, of course). Just click on the 
            star representing your review (for example, click on the fourth 
            star from the left to give a four-star review) and write a 
            comment, and then click "post!"
        </p><br>
        <h2>Adding a Recipe</h2>
        <p>
            If you're logged in, you can add your own recipes. But be careful!
            If you are not logged in, then you will be redirected back to the
            login page so you can log in and post your delicious treats. When
            you add a recipe, you will be asked for your recipe's title, the 
            grams of protein, carbs, and fat present, the recipe instructions,
            and an image to go along with your recipe. In addition, you can
            specify the ingredients in your recipe. You can add as many 
            ingredients as you'd like, but make sure to click on "Add 
            ingredient" as many times as there are ingredients in your recipe
            <i>before</i> you add all of your ingredients. You cannot add on 
            new ones as you go along. Finally, once you're done creating your 
            recipe, click "Create Post" to add your recipe to our website. You
            can go back up to the navigation bar and click "Explore recipes" 
            and then search for your recipe to admire the awesome work you 
            just did!
